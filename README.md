# JS aync code tutorial

Simple examples with different implementations based on:
+ callbacks
+ promises
+ async/await

## Details

This test code plays with the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/)

Run `npm test` and you should see the same results for all the implementations. However, you may notice that **async/await** code is simpler to read than **promise** one... and far more easy to follow than **callback** (hell) code ;)

Compare `getLuke` and you should understand why Promises were a huge improvement and async/await was waited for so long.
